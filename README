Background:

Our project is to implement a image classifier. The framework we used is Convolutional Neural Network. Convolutional layers are 
used to map the features of images. Then fully connected layers will be used to do classification. 


Project Structure:
MAIN.py is used to run our project. All the functions we used are decleared in functions.py.
All the implementations of neural networks are in MODEL folder and trained models will be saved in result folder.


Intall:

To run our project, pytorch package needs to be installed. Dataset will be automatically downloaded and verified.



Algorithms:

ResNet18: In the resnet.py, residual block, residual neural network and shortcut connections are defined to use this model.
LeNet5: Network structure is implemented in LeNet5.py.



Evaluations:
During training stage, our code will print out the loss and accuracy each iteration. Testing will be enabled when one epoch's training
is finished and the accuracy will be printed.
If you want to check confusion matrix and learning curve for one model, you need to run the code again once taining is finished.
There is a option to test your saved model.
