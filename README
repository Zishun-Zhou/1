Background:

Our project is to implement a image classifier. The framework we used is Convolutional Neural Network. Convolutional layers are 
used to map the features of images. Then fully connected layers will be used to do classification. 


Project Structure:
MAIN.py is used to run our project. All the functions we used are decleared in functions.py.
All the implementations of neural networks are in MODEL folder and trained models will be stored in result folder.


Intall:

To run our project, pytorch package needs to be installed. Dataset will be automatically downloaded and verified.



Algorithms:

ResNet18: In the resnet.py file, residual block, residual neural network and shortcut connections are declared to use this model.
