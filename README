Background


Our project is to implement a image classifier. The framework we used is Convolutional Neural Network. Convolutional layers are used to map the features of images. Then fully connected layers will be used to do classification. 



Intall:

To run our project, pytorch package needs to be installed.



Algorithms:

ResNet: In the resnet.py file, residual block, neural network and shortcut connections are declared. main function and other functions used
are decleard in train.py. To obtain evaluations, run the train.py file.



Evaluations

ResNet: check the confusionMatrix_50epochs.png and learningcurve_50epochs.png files.
