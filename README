Background


Our project is to implement a image classifier. The framework we used is Convolutional Neural Network. Convolutional layers are 
used to map the features of images. Then fully connected layers will be used to do classification. 

All neural networks are in MODEL folder and trained model store in result folder ready to do testing.

Intall:

To run our project, pytorch package needs to be installed.



Algorithms:

ResNet18: In the resnet.py file, residual block, residual neural network and shortcut connections are declared to use this model.
